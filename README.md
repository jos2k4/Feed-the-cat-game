Hi there, thanks you for looking around. I started this project just for fun there are no intentions in making money with it. The project is still in development. Feel free to try it out but don't expect too much yet :) 

Run the file "Feed-The-Cat-v4" to start the game. You will have to install python and pygame with the command:

python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

in your cmd.
